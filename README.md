You have to use Unity 2019.3.0f6 & Hybrid Renderer v0.3.3 for this project

I used DOTS [in Unity Engine its name is ECS, for example, it is Nanite in Unreal Engine] for the first time in this project. It is incredible technology and I believe it is the future of the game industry. 

This technology's main focus is to manage entities with source efficiency. This needs a whole new perspective to work with. And its code structure and syntax are very different from object-oriented programing.
